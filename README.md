The React "Employee Table" application is developed based on React tutorial by Tania Rascia.
It is a very good tutorial to get a grasp of all the main concepts of React.

It is composed of Components like :
- App.js  # main Application component.
- Form.js # A component that allows to add new employees.
- Table.js # A component that allows to view employees as a table.


- Api.js # Additional component, just to view what is fetched from Wikipedia API.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
